	Overview of Jenkins :::


		Jenkins is an Open-Source Build Orchestration Tool.
		
		
		- Archetecture of Jenkins :
		
		
			- Based on Master/Slave Archetecture
			
				Jenkins_Master Node  (VM)			==> Is used create Jenkins Projects/Pipelines Jobs to Automate the process.
														Is used to schedule the builds in the Jenkins Slave Nodes.
														
					Jenkins_Slave Node (VM)			==> Used of Perform Application Build 


	Build Orchestration Tool - Jenkins
	
	Jenkins :::
	
	Continuous Development & Continuous Integration ::::
	
		Using DevOps Approach ::
			Developers :
			-- Create Application Source Code 
			-- Commit the Source Code to Source Code Repository like github
			
			Using DevOps Process :
			Automate ::

			- Build the code - Compile and create artifacts 					
			- Unit Testing 					
			- Promote the Application to higher testing Environment					
			- Notify the Testing/Development Team 	

		Tools :::
		
			- Eclipse based IDEs - like Eclipse for Java,Pycharm,Intellij, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code
			- Source Code Management Tool - like github/AWS Code Commit/Azure Repos 
			- Jenkins/AzurePipeline/AWS CodeBuild/gitlab-ci			
		
	What is Jenkins :::
	
		Jenkins is Open-Source Build Orchestration Tool.
		Used to Automate the End-to-End Application Build and Deployments
		Using Jenkins we can create CI/CD Pipelines 
		
	Jenkins Architecture ::
	
		Jenkins is based on Master-Slave Architecture :::
		
			Jenkins_Master (VM)				==> Install Jenkins - To Create Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline Jobs/Projects
				Jenkins_SlaveNode1 (VM)		==> Perform Application Builds - compile/create artifacts
