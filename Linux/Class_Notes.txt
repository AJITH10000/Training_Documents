Operating System :::

	Fundamentals of Linux Operating System 
	
		- Windows 
		- Mac 
		- Linux 
		
	Linux Operating System 
		- Open-Source 
		- Is Secured 
		- Linux OS was created based on the Unix Operating System 
		- Is an interface between the user applications and underlying Hardware.
		- Linux OS is based on the Command User Interface
		- Core of Linux OS is called kernel!
			Components of Linux OS Architecture
				- Networking 
				- Storage 
				- IPC - Inter Process Communication
				- User Management 
				- Security Management 
				- Control Groups 
				- Namespace 
				- Process 
			
		- Command Line Interface 
		
	Linux Distributions --> 
	
		--> Versions or types of Linux OS.
		--> Flavor of Linux OS
		
		- Centos / RHEL 
		
		- Debian / Ubuntu
		
		- Fedoro
		
		- Amazon Linux2 
		
			-> Based on Federo Distribution
			
		
		- Packages :::
		
			Package Management - Package Managers :::
				- Package Managers are used to install/Uninstall/Upgrade the Packages/software 
			
					- Centos / RHEL 		===> 	yum package Manager 
					- Debian / Ubuntu 		===>	apt/apt-get package Manager 
					- Fedora				===>	dnf (Latest Version of Fedora)
													yum (Previous Version of Fedora)
													
				- Package Managers can be executed only by the root user on Linux
				
					- TO work with Package Manager :
						- Elevate the Access to Root Level 
							- sudo -i			# This Command is used to elevate the access to root level


	Learn Linux on DevOps Perspectives :
	
		What the Role of DevOps Team/Engineer on Linux.
		
			- All the DevOps Tools can be installed and Managed in Linux Machines 
		
		What is your role here ????
		
			- Install all the DevOps Tools 
			- Package Management - Periodically Upgrade/Uninstall - Backup of the Tools
			- Managing Remote Servers 
				- Client Server Architecture 
				- Server1 (VM)
					- Client1,2,3,4,5,6
					
			- As a DevOps Team we can Manage the Linux Machines
			
				- Package Management 
				- File Management 
				- User Management 
				- Access Management 
				- Remote Servers Management 
				- Process Automation(Shell Scripting)
				
	AWS Cloud Platform :
	
		--> Create Virtual Machines(VM) - Linux based OS 
				--> Install and work with DevOps Tools 
	
	Lab Environment ::::
	
		- Create a Fier Tier Account on AWS Cloud 		# aws.amazon.com/console/
														# https://signin.aws.amazon.com/signup?request_type=register
														
			- Avail Free Tier Account access for 12 Months
		
		- Active Email_ID, Mobile Number, Credit/Debit Card(International Transaction Enabled)
		
		- Create Free-tier AWS Account - Basic Plan 
		
		- Login to AWS Console as a root user.		# aws.amazon.com/console/
			- Email_ID 
			- Password 
		
		- Access to AWS Console :
		
			- EC2 Service (Elastic Compute Service) --> Create EC2 Instances VM.
			
			
		- Working with (VM) EC2 Instances :
		
			- Create an EC2 Instance
			
				- Name/Tag
				
				- AMI - Amazon Machine Image 			# Identify the type of OS - Amazon Linux/Ubuntu/Windows/Mac
				- Instance Type 						# CPU & RAM 
				- Key Pairs								# Used to Securely Login to EC2 Instances 
				
				
				- Network
				- Security Group 
				- Volumes 
				
					Authentication Types :
					
						SSH Connection to any Linux based Remote Servers 
						
							- Password based Authentication
							- Token based Authentication
							- Key-Based Authentication
								- Public Key/Authorized Key 
								- Private Key 
							- Passwordless Connection
							
Next :

	- Launch an EC2 Instance 
			- ubuntu v22.04 AMI 
			- t2.mirco
			
	- Connect to EC2 Instance

			Using SSH Connection

	- Working with Linux 	
			
				- Package Management 
				- File Management 
				- User Management 
				- Access Management 
				- Remote Servers Management 
				- Process Automation(Shell Scripting)
